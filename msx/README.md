# ZX Desk for MSX1

The MSX1 port lives under `msx/`. The ZX tree above it is the source it
is ported from and stays untouched.

    msx/test.sh             build the toolchain image once, assemble, run every subject, assert
    msx/test.sh --shell     a shell inside the image
    REBUILD=1 msx/test.sh   rebuild the image after a Dockerfile change
    msx/run.sh              build and run it in a visible openMSX: the host's
                            (dnf install openmsx cbios) or the image on the
                            host display with the GPU passed in

Everything runs in `msx/docker`: Debian trixie with openMSX 20.0,
C-BIOS 0.29a, pasmo 0.5.5 built from source, Xvfb and xdotool. Nothing
needs to be installed on the host but Docker.

## Toolchain notes, measured

- **pasmo 0.5.3 (Debian) does not assemble the ZX source**: it has no
  `IFDEF` and fails on line 88 of zxdesk.asm. 0.5.5 from
  pasmo.speccy.org assembles it (22,961 byte TEST build), so the image
  builds 0.5.5 from the tarball, checked against its sha256.
- **openMSX 19.1 is packaged nowhere current**; trixie ships 20.0,
  bookworm 18.0. 20.0 it is.
- The Debian `cbios` package links only some of its ROMs into openMSX's
  systemroms; `C-BIOS_MSX1_EU` (the 50 Hz machine) is missing its main
  ROM until the Dockerfile links the rest.
- openMSX's SDL init asserts under `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`, so it runs
  under Xvfb. It also segfaults when `getpwuid()` finds no entry for the
  calling uid, which is why `test.sh --shell` mounts `/etc/passwd` read-only. The test run itself streams the tree in and `msx/build` out with tar, so it also works from a container that only has the docker socket.
- `after boot` in openMSX fires at power-on, not when C-BIOS has finished
  its logo (about 3.1 s emulated). The driver script waits for the ROM's
  marker in work RAM instead of a fixed delay.
- Tcl `puts` inside openMSX goes to its own console, not stdout, and an
  error inside an `after` callback is swallowed and the emulator runs
  forever. The driver writes a log file and has a realtime guard.
- With the throttle off the renderer skips frames and a screenshot is
  black. The driver switches the throttle on for ten frames before the
  capture; inside a proc that must be `set ::throttle`, a bare `set`
  makes a local variable.
- The VDP address latch is reset by a status-register read, and the
  BIOS interrupt handler does one every frame. An interrupt between the
  two control writes of `SetWrt` sends the data elsewhere: on the 60 Hz
  machine that hit desktop row 6 on every boot (name table crc32
  d4ebe497 instead of b905ed57). `SetWrt` holds DI across the pair.
- C-BIOS's CHGMOD 2 leaves the pattern table clear where the real BIOS
  loads its font, so the ROM copies glyphs 32-127 from the BIOS's
  CGTABL pointer itself and the harness asserts that copy against the
  BIOS ROM it read back.

## The harness

`msx/msxtest.py` (the model is `zxtest.py` in the ZX tree) assembles
`msx/src/msxdesk.asm` into a padded 32K `page12` ROM, boots it in
`C-BIOS_MSX1_EU` with the throttle off, runs a step list through
`msx/harness/run.tcl`, and reads VRAM (16K) and work RAM ($C000-$FFFF)
back through `debug read_block`. Checksums are the assertion; the
screenshot in `msx/build/out/<subject>/shot.png` is for people.

Input injection:

- keys go through `keymatrixdown <row> <mask>`, the PPI matrix;
- the mouse is `plug joyporta mouse` plus `xdotool` moving the Xvfb
  pointer, which openMSX turns into the joystick-port strobe protocol.
  Measured on openMSX 20.0: a host move of n pixels arrives as -n/2
  (openMSX halves host motion; an MSX mouse reports the negative of
  the movement), so the ROM subtracts the deltas. openMSX resets the
  strobe phase after 1.5 ms without a strobe, which is what makes a
  once-a-frame read see fresh deltas. The buttons ride on bits 4 and 5
  of the same byte, and ApplyDelta clobbers E: read them first.

Steps are timed on the ROM's own frame counter (`Frames` at $C008),
polled every emulated frame: a key changed when the counter reads T is
seen by exactly the poll of iteration T+1, so a held key's frame count
is a number, not a window.

Subjects, all asserted (phase 1):

| subject | what is checked |
|---|---|
| boot | VDP R1 $E2 (16x16 sprites; CHGMOD leaves 8x8 and the arrow lost its tail), R7 white border; name table = the Python oracle (bar text, rule row, lattice, status band), crc32 b905ed57; the BIOS font (crc32 897a8dfc on C-BIOS) and the two tiles in all three thirds of the PGT; sprite shape at $3800 and attributes (89,120,0,1) + end marker; H.TIMI: interrupts == frames, 0 dropped; pointer idle, no events |
| mouse | host (+20, -30) → pointer (130, 75), sprite follows, exactly 2 EV_PTRMOVE and no button events |
| cursor | RIGHT held 20 frames, DOWN 10 → (158, 103), the ramp recomputed in Python; 30 moves, no key events |
| keys | A, SHIFT+1, SPACE → 3 EV_KEY, one EV_BTNDOWN, one EV_BTNUP, status row echoes `A! ` |
| repeat | C held 30 frames → 5 EV_KEY (1 + 1 at 20 + 3 more every 3), `CCCCC` on the status row |

Both C-BIOS_MSX1_EU (50 Hz) and C-BIOS_MSX1_JP (60 Hz) pass.

## Memory budget

The build prints it and fails past the line:

    code $4000-$4634, 1588 bytes, 31180 free; RAM $C000-$C06E, 110 bytes, 12050 free before the stack

Work RAM is handed out by the `var` macro in msxdesk.asm from $C000 up;
`RamEnd` must stay under $F380 - $400 (BIOS work area, and a stack).

## Screen model, phase 1

Screen 2's colour table is one colour byte per pattern row per third of
the screen, so the same glyph is black on white in the bar's third and
white on black in the status row's third without a second copy. The
middle third (rows 8-15) has no text yet; when windows put text there,
that third's glyph colours will be theirs, and a window title bar that
wants a second scheme in the same third needs a second glyph bank
(96 glyphs x 8 = 768 bytes of PGT per bank per third).
