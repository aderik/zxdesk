# BENCH=1 ./build.sh builds the timing harness instead of the desktop.
# DEMO=1, NOWAIT=1 and SCRIPT=1 are the other build flags and were
# documented without being reachable from here, so they had to be run
# by invoking pasmo by hand. DEMO in particular is how A2 gets tested
# against the real ULA: it drags the window by itself, so every frame
# goes through DevFillDesk, and the status row's drop count says
# whether any of those frames lost their interrupt.
# BENCH is the timing harness, which needs Fuse. TEST is the
# correctness subjects, which zxtest.py runs headlessly. They used to
# be one binary and were competing for the same fifteen kilobytes, so
# each now carries only its own half; HARNESS is what both halves'
# shared parts are guarded by.
